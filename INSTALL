Pretty easy:

$ git clone https://ijstokes@github.com/ijstokes/dropboxcli.git
$ export PATH=`pwd`/dropboxcli/bin

You can then use the "-d" command line option to specify the directory which
dropbox_cli commands work on, or you can set DROPBOX_HOME.

NOTE: This is a little misleading, because the Dropbox directory will
        actually be:

$DROPBOX_HOME/Dropbox

After a Dropbox directory has been created, stop the daemon and then use the
tool "dropbox_dir" to move the dropbox directory.
